The itools package is a set of user friendly applications utilizing
Arabeyes' ITL library.

The package currently addresses two main areas - hijri date and prayertime
calculation.  The package is envisioned to mimick the development of the
underlying ITL library and is meant to always give the end-user a simple
means to access its functions.
