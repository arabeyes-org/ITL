  Details:
----------

The main goal of this library is to allow applications to generate
accurate prayer time results based on the user location and Fiqh
method settings. This library is intended to be used in Calendar/Task
applications, Adhan (prayer call reminder) programs or any other
software where such data might be needed.

To learn more about the library interface, read "src/prayer.h".

This library is free software, distributed under the terms of The GNU
Lesser General Public License (LGPL). This library is currently
included as part of the ITL project at Arabeyes.org.
 

-----------------------------------------------------
  Supported Methods of calculation and Fiqh settings:
-----------------------------------------------------

By passing the appropriate values to the Method structure, the library
is able to support all known methods of prayer time calculations for
all the different schools of Fiqh there is. More importantly, the
library is not restricted to a certain Fiqh, but instead, the user is
fully able to customize the calculation method used based on his/her
own school of Fiqh, actual observations, or scientific research.

Bearing that in mind, the library does provide auto-fill methods for
the most commonly used methods in many countries around the world. In
addition to that, the library supports all known methods of prayer
time simulation for high (49+) and extreme (66+) latitudes, as
recommended by both traditional and modern scholarship.

See the "doc/method-info.txt" file for the complete details.


-----------
  Examples:
-----------

The "demo_prayer.c" file shows a small example of using the library
from the command line.

Also part of the full ITL library package is a "swig" directory that
shows in example of creating a wrapper library using SWIG and
accessing the library routines through a PERL script. (More info. at
www.swig.org)


-----------------------------
  Bugs and Other Limitations:
-----------------------------

The current true North Qibla formula is a little too simplistic for
such task. Also we do not currently have support for magnetic Qibla
calculations. More documentation and better error checking for the
prayer code.

Most of these issues will be dealt with in future releases,
Insha'allah
